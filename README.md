Gabe's game was a simulation of a childhood favorite game of mine Pokemon.  

It prompted the user to choose between fighting or walking around to encounter different pokemon.  

Your pokemon is charmander, and I battled between a Rayquaza as well as an Eevee.  Fun game.  I enjoyed playing through it a few times.
